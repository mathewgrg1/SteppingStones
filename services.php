  <dt style="color:salmon"><h1>Education</h1></dt>
 <br> <dd><h3>Improve position in society:</h3> All money in the world will not give you satisfaction and prestige as the education can. Women were enslaved and looked down upon due to the lack of education. As they become literate the outlook of the society improved. In fact, if you want to move within the certain segment of the people, it is important to be qualified or get a certain level of education.</dd>
  <br><dd><h3>Education is responsible for achieving the goals in life:</h3> An ignorant individual would never be able to plan and achieve success. It is only possible with the help of sustained education at different levels. Without the capability to read, write and think, human life is no better than an animal. Knowledge provides numerous means to the people to accomplish the goals. For instance, if you want to become a successful entrepreneur, it is necessary to get an education about the relevant business domain.</dd>
 <br> <dd><h3>Education helps in evolution:</h3> Education plays an important role in the evolution of human life. Television became the household commodity in the 20th century while internet took over in 21st. Advancement in technology is only possible due to the education.      Ignorant people are not able to understand the logic behind the natural phenomenon and are not able to develop a vision for the future.</dd>
  <br><dd>Child attending schools are taught under the supervision of capable teachers. They understand the essence of life and gain invaluable knowledge about their surroundings. Fostering basic principles of humanity and reasoning, the modern education is an eye opener for every person on earth. In short, a balanced life and reputed standing in society is only possible with the shining light of knowledge.</dd><br>
  <dt style="color:salmon"><h1>Food</h1></dt><br>
  <dd>As you can see from the World Hunger Map hunger exists all over the world.However the majority of undernourished people live in the developing world and earn
  less than $1 a day.Over 314 million of the world’s hungry live in South Asia - this is more than thepopulation of Australia and the USA.
  Sub-Saharan Africa also has a huge number of hungry people, with over 30% of thepopulation being undernourished.The majority of hungry people in these countries are children under the age of 5. 
</dd><br>
<dd><h3>Food and Nutrition in Daily Life:</h3> Everyday we have to make decisions about what kind of food we want to eat and what kind of nutrition every food product will provide. It’s the nutritional choices that we make every day that will determine how healthy we will be in the long run. Too much food can make us obese, while too little nutrition can lead to malnourishment. 

The right foundation to good health is to choose food products that are rich in nutrients and have a balanced amount of nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates and a little bit of fat as well. If you choose your foods wisely, you will be able to enjoy the experience of eating, as the right foods will help you remain healthy. </dd> 
<br><dt style="color:salmon"><h1>Work</h1></dt><br>
<dd>We often see a lot of people complaining about work. A majority of them regard working as an extremely hard, vapid and low earning affliction. They always dream to live a happy life without working. But in reality, it’s is not possible to live without doing work. Each individual needs to work for various reasons, no matter whether he is the son of the billionaire or a layman struggling with poverty. To the best of my knowledge, the most common reasons for people to work are to acquire enormous knowledge, money and to enjoy life</dd>
<br><dd>Firstly, people work to sharpen their skills as well as to learn many aspects of knowledge to solve the problems that helps them to overcome difficulties. Work gives us wisdom. Without working no one can improve his/her skills, knowledge and intelligence. Thus those who work hard enjoy a wonderful life.</dd>
